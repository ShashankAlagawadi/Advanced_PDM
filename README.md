## 🚀 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on predictive maintenance strategies for industrial machinery using cutting-edge machine learning models. It aims to:

- Detect early signs of equipment failure.
- Optimize maintenance strategies through cost-effectiveness analysis.
- Implement proactive decision-making to minimize downtime.
- Support Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 9, 12, and 13).

We utilize ensemble classification algorithms to enhance accuracy and reliability, allowing industries to forecast equipment failures efficiently.
